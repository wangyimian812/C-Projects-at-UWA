To test runml.c, first compile the code by running: gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -o runml runml.c

There are 4 sample inputs available for testing. To test the first sample, run: ./runml sample01

runml.c is a C mini compiler that removes comments, validates identifiers, converts assignment symbols, and adds semicolons. It demonstrates my ability to create efficient solutions with strong error handling. 



To test simulation.c, first compile the code by running: gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -o simulation simulation.c

Create in.txt by: vim in.txt

Write: 0 1 2 3 to in.txt

Then run the code: ./simulation in.txt out.txt

simulation.c simulates virtual memory management with Local and Global LRU page replacement policies across multiple processes. This project highlights my systems programming skills and attention to detail.
